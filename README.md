An app that updates the hosts file when the ip of a certain mac address changes
<p>
  This app waa made so that I wouldn't have to keep opening netsh portproxy everytime
  the DHCP lease expires. Basically I used the execute command feature on Nirsoft's 
  Network Watcher tool, and tell portproxy to use a hostname instead of a IP address.
